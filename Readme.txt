Instruction of WPF UI Operation

1. Input Client Port
2. Click "Listen" button once, start listening
3. Input Server Addr and Port, Click "Add Server" Button
4. Input another Server Addr and Port, Click "Add Server" Button
5. Input cmd
6. Click "Send" Button

Attention: 
If adding a wrong server address and port, plz reopen the client. I have decided to add a "Reset" button but time is not enough.
The main function is totally completed.

Thank you!
